# ControlCSGO

This shit has been laying on my HDD for ages...
Planned to sell it (lol i know right), but here you go, maybe some people can learn.

As i said, code is really fucking old and i won't ever need it.
Naming convention is shitty, thread system is shitty, code is shitty -  everything needs a rework.

Notice:  lot of hardcoded shit and bad practices, hf
